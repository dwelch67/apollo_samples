Elementary blinker.

They have pad controls separate from the gpio peripheral controls which
is interesting and good.  The reset value for the pad controls is what
we want for this example so dont need to modify them.

The dummy loop simply burns time so you can see the led, no precision
time value, depends in part on your compiler.
