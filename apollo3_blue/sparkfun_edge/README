Was wondering if I was ever going to mess with one of these Ambiq
parts.  Not at mouser and they are BGA so I hit two strikes there.

SparkFun Edge Development Board - Apollo3 Blue
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170

https://ambiqmicro.com/mcu/

Get the Datasheet.

http://infocenter.arm.com

Get the ARMv7m Architectural Reference Manual
and the cortex-m4 Technical Reference Manual

(from the datasheet and Ambiq website we know this contains a
cortex-m4 core)

LEDS:

GPIO 46
GPIO 37
GPIO 44
GPIO 47

They python files in this directory are from the Ambiq SDK and
from Sparkfun.  I suspect sparkfun modified the bootloader, which
means maybe we can too.  We will see.  They have some form of secure
boot(loader) which requires this stuff, I didnt make my own version
of this stuff nor have I replaced the bootloader, but will see how
that goes over time.

To write a program to the board first run make to build the

main_nonsecure_wire.bin

file, then press and hold the button that has a 14 next to it,
press and release the button with rst next to it, do not release
the 14 button yet.  run

make prog

THEN you can release 14, and press reset to run the program.

Looks like this:

make

arm-none-eabi-gcc -Wall -Werror -O2 -nostdlib -nostartfiles -ffreestanding  -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb -c notmain.c -o notmain.o
